.discover(AI) dives deep into learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence. The program teaches students to think critically about various topics surrounding machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

The session will be divided into three main sessions. First, pupils will learn how to preprocess and clean data. Then, pupils will learn about supervised learning, followed by unsupervised learning algorithms. Supervised learning algorithms will include linear regression, cross validation, logistic regression, K nearest neighbours, support vector machines, naive bayes, decision trees, and random forests. Unsupervised learning algorithms will include K-means, dimensionality reduction, and PCA. The first session will contain an introduction to machine learning (including history, applications, etc.), and the final session will contain future learning opportunities.
