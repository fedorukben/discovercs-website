			/*<br>
				.discover(CS) was born out of a desire to grow the compute rscience community.
				Computer science teachers typically do not have specialization or real0world experience.
				As such, we pair small groups of students with mentors who have considerable skill in their respective fields.
				We aspire to allow students to discover the array of fields within the broader computer science discipline.
