			The Discover Computer Science Youth Mentorship Program's Board of Directors is thrilled to announce our Fall 2021 session: .discover(AI). This session will focus on machine learning, and will teach students the fundamentals of both supervised and unsupervised systems. The mentor for this course, Shreya, is a recent graduate of the Masters of Computer Science program at Lakehead University, specializing in machine learning! Just a reminder: this course is entirely free to any young people. .discover(CS) is committed to removing any potential barriers for entry into the computer science discipline. For more information or to sign up, please feel free to email <a href="mailto:ai@discovercs.ca">ai@discovercs.ca</a>. We hope to talk with you soon, and hope you enjoy .discover(AI)!
