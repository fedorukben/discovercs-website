			/*
			.discover(CS) was born out of a desire to grow the<br>
			computer science community. Computer science teachers<br>
			typically do not have specialization or real-world<br>
			experience. As such, we pair small groups of students<br>
			with mentors who have considerable skill in their<br>
			respective fields. We aspire to allow students to<br>
			discover the array of fields within the broader computer<br>
			science discipline.
