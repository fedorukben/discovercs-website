			.discover(CS) was born out of a desire to grow thecomputer science 
			community. Computer science teacherstypically do not have 
			specialization or real-worldexperience. As such, we pair small 
			groups of studentswith mentors who have considerable skill in 
			their respective fields. We aspire to allow students to discover
			 the array of fields within the broader computerscience discipline.
