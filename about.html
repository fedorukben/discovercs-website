			/*<br>
.discover(CS) was born out of a desire to grow the computer science community. Computer science teachers typically do not have specialization or real-world experience. As such, we pair small groups of pupils (students) with mentors who have considerable skill in their respective fields. We aspire to allow pupils to discover the array of fields within the broader computer science discipline. 
			<br>/*<br><br>
			/*<br>
We hire individuals who have demonstrably deep skill in a specific field of computer science. These mentors have both a knowledge and passion for their field, and a knowledge and passion for youth education. We believe that students in high school often have a difficult decision to make regarding their future career path. Students ask "Should I go to university, college, an apprenticeship, or the workforce? What program should I take? Where should I work? Who can help guide me?" Mentors as .discover(CS) are encouraged to help students to answer these specific questions in the computer science discipline, providing first-hand experiences. When pupils complete a session, they have made industry connections with their mentor.
